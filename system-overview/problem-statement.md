# Problem Statement

Administrative and project workflows frequently fail due to:
- Static task prioritization
- Lack of risk visibility
- Unclear ownership
- Missing documentation
- Reactive handling of issues

These failures increase operational friction, delay delivery,
and introduce avoidable risk.

This system defines a structured, predictable approach to task
management and operational decision-making that is independent
of any specific software tool.
