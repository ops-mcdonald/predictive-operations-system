# Decision Logic

## Priority Calculation
Priority is derived from:
- Time remaining until due date
- Task status
- Impact level

Priority must be recalculated dynamically as conditions change.

## Risk Identification
Risk is flagged when:
- Tasks become overdue
- High-priority tasks lack ownership
- Dependencies are blocked
- Escalation thresholds are crossed

## Escalation Triggers
Escalation occurs when:
- Risk remains unresolved
- Deadlines are missed
- Security boundaries are violated
