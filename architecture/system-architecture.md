# System Architecture

The system is composed of five conceptual layers:

1. Intake Layer – captures tasks and metadata
2. Decision Layer – calculates priority and risk
3. Execution Layer – performs work
4. Monitoring Layer – tracks changes and thresholds
5. Escalation Layer – responds to failures and risks

Each layer is documented independently to allow flexible implementation.
