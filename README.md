# Predictive Operations System

## Overview
This repository documents a lightweight, tool-agnostic operations system designed to
prioritize tasks, predict operational risk, and support administrative and project workflows.

The system is intentionally documented without reliance on screenshots or proprietary tools
to demonstrate transferable systems thinking and decision logic.

## Core Capabilities
- Dynamic task prioritization
- Predictive risk detection
- Standardized operational procedures
- Security and privacy governance
- Scenario-based failure handling

## Intended Use Cases
- Administrative operations
- Project support
- Small business operations
- Remote and distributed teams

## Design Philosophy
- Logic over tooling
- Predictive over reactive
- Documented over ad-hoc
- Secure by default
